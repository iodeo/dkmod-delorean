# Delorean Mods on Electronic devices control

## Our principles in Extension boards design

Our extension boards are designed to respect the following rules:

1. Fit in existing model perfectly

2. Be plug and play

3. Be end-user friendly (not only for programmer)

4. Be open source and customisable

## Our boards

We are starting with boards which enable Delorean remote control

### Delorean RF Controller

This board enables to remote control the 6 buttons of the model with a nice remote.
The physical buttons can still be used in parallel.

Some optional extras may be added such as:
- Adding a command to control the 6 buttons in a row
- Adding a sequencer

### Delorean RF Player

This board is an extension to the RF Controller that integrates a MP3 player.
Being so enthousiastic about embedding music player in the model, a bunch of functionalities have been developped in the board software. Today, the functionalities are:

1. Play music from a playlist
2. Navigate in the playlist
3. Change volume
4. Change equalizer
5. Advertise randomly from another playlist (so cool to play your favourite sentences from the movie)
6. Record / Play a sequence of commands timely on a music track
7. Powering on/off all the devices

This board is like the ultimate one !
But yeah, there's a drawback since the original 3xAA battery leads to ridiculous autonomy.
In fact, the music player with its 3w audio amplifier requires a 5V 2A power supply to work correctly.
